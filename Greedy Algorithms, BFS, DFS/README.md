A collection of programs that:\
Find the shortest route through a graph of nodes in NetworkX using breadth-first and depth-first searches.\
Find the maximum shortest (i.e. longest direct) distance between any two nodes in a network (i.e. diameter of a network).\
Greedily colour a network such that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour; via either a breadth-first search or ordering.
